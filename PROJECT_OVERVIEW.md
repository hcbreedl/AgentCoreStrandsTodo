## 🛠️ Key Concepts to Learn

As you work through this project, you'll learn:

1. **Agents**: AI entities that process requests
2. **Tools**: Functions agents can call
3. **System Prompts**: Instructions for agent behavior
4. **Natural Language Processing**: How agents understand you
5. **State Management**: Persisting data (JSON file)
6. **AWS Integration**: Using Bedrock models

## 💡 Experiment Ideas

Once you have the basics working, try:

1. **Change Personality**: Make agent more formal/casual
2. **Add Features**: Search tasks, set priorities, due dates
3. **Better Storage**: Replace JSON with database
4. **Web Interface**: Create a simple web UI
5. **Multiple Agents**: Create agents that collaborate
6. **Integration**: Connect to other AWS services

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. **Check the guides**: README, LEARNING_GUIDE, SETUP_NOTES
2. **Review code comments**: Well-documented for learning
3. **Test incrementally**: Get one thing working, then add more
4. **AWS Documentation**: Official docs for AgentCore
5. **Experiment**: Try things - that's how you learn!

## ✅ Success Checklist

You'll know you've mastered this when you can:

- [ ] Run the agent locally without errors
- [ ] Explain what an agent and tools are
- [ ] Modify the system prompt and see behavior change
- [ ] Add a new tool function
- [ ] Understand how the agent processes requests
- [ ] Deploy to AgentCore (optional but recommended)

## 🚀 Next Steps After This Project

After completing this project, consider:

1. **Real Applications**: Build something you'll actually use
2. **Advanced Features**: Multi-agent systems, complex tools
3. **Production Practices**: Error handling, logging, monitoring
4. **Integration**: Connect to databases, APIs, other services
5. **Scale**: Handle multiple users, concurrent requests

## 🎉 Have Fun!

This is a learning project. Don't be afraid to:
- Break things (you can always restore)
- Try weird ideas
- Read the code carefully
- Ask questions
- Experiment!

The goal is understanding, not perfection. Enjoy the journey! 🚀
